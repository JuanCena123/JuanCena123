    Hi, I'm John and this is my personal website for showcasing my experience and side projects. Currently I am in the process of
    improving/revising projects that I worked in the past. These projects are ones that I didn't necessarily apply myself to and
    could really improve from where I left them.
</p>

<h3>Current Focus</h3>
<p>
    The project that I am currently focused on is a structure from motion program or notebook. The concept is not exactly state of
    the art as far as I am aware, however I find it very interesting. I originally started working on this about a year ago for a
    creative inquiry that I was apart of at Clemson that introduced students to machine learning and gave them the tools to work on
    their own projects. I did not give the class the attention that I should've and my projects never got to where they should've
    been, hence my working on them now. In hope of doing things right this time I am reading Packt's opencv4 textbook to gain a
    deeper understanding of the underlying concepts that make sfm possible as I begin to code the notebook. The data/competition 
    is from Kaggle, more specifically googles/happiers yearly image matching competition.
